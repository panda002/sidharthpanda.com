                        <p>
                        Here I will try to answer("my experience") some of the common questions I get on LinkedIn regarding my MS in CS at UNC Charlotte.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            Q - 1. How is the faculty, courses structure and coursework?
                            <br>
                            A - All the professors are pretty cool in the College of Computing and Informatics. 
                            <br>You can find more information at https://cci.uncc.edu/directory/faculty
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Q - In how many Semester can we complete the Masters?
                           <br>
                           A - One can complete in 3 Semester or 4. When you register for the course, do visit the Degree Works portal in myuncc.edu to see the
                           courses you need to take for your degree completion. For me, i had to take 10 subjects of 3 credits each to complete my degree in Computer science. I completed in 3 sems in the format 3-3-4(3 subjects in the first sem(Fall19), 3 in second(Spring20) and 4 in the third(Fall20))
                           <br>
                           There are more than 1 format you can follow to complete the degree in less than 4 sems. For example you can also take summer classes and reduce the last sem coursework to 3 subs.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                           Q - Let me know about RA, TA and other on campus opportunity.
                           <br>
                           A - It's a it difficult to get RA or TA in the first semester but not impossible since they haven't interacted with you yet (Differs from department to department). BUT, if you have a friend or a senior working under a professor then he/she can refer you for the position if any available. Make sure you have the prior experience in that particular subjects.
                           Important point to note is to email the professors for TA/RA and to follow up for the same. Send them request on the linkedIn too.
                           <br>
                           For the students who don't get a TA/RA position in the first semester can also work oncampus at various location in the university campus. For this they can visit the location and ask the manager if any positions are available. These include subway, wendy's etc. Also you can apply in the hire-a-niner portal for any student union jobs which includes jobs like - technician, front desk etc.
                           <br><br>
                           Important thing to note here is not to be taken by the flow of earning money since the end goal of your degree is to get an internship and secure a full-time postion.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                           Q - How to choose the subjects for each semester?
                           <br>
                           A - First, visit the degree requirement page for each departent. For example - https://cci.uncc.edu/academics/computer-science/masters-program/ms-requirements
                           Then ask your seniors which subjects are hard/medium/easy. It differs from professor to professor and their course structures. If you have a oncampus job then it becomes slighly difficult to attend the 4 classes and at the same time complete the assignments and prepare for your job interviews.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                           If you have any other questions apart from these then you can drop a msg at  -
