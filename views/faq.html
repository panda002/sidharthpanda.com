                    <h3>letâ€™s Start with </h3><br>
                    <h2>UNC Charlotte</h2>
                    <p>
                        Here I will try to answer("my experience") some of the common questions I get on LinkedIn
                        regarding my MS in CS at UNC Charlotte.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Q - How is the faculty, courses structure and coursework?
                        <br>
                        A - All the professors are pretty cool in the College of Computing and Informatics.
                        <br>You can find more information at https://cci.uncc.edu/directory/faculty
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Q - In how many Semester can we complete the Masters?
                        <br>
                        A - One can complete in 3 Semester or 4. When you register for the course, do visit the Degree
                        Works portal in myuncc.edu to see the
                        courses you need to take for your degree completion. For me, i had to take 10 subjects of 3
                        credits each to complete my degree in Computer science. I completed in 3 sems in the format
                        3-3-4(3 subjects in the first sem(Fall19), 3 in second(Spring20) and 4 in the third(Fall20))
                        <br>
                        There are more than 1 format you can follow to complete the degree in less than 4 sems. For
                        example you can also take summer classes and reduce the last sem coursework to 3 subs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Q - Let me know about RA, TA and other on campus opportunity.
                        <br>
                        A - It's a it difficult to get RA or TA in the first semester but not impossible since they
                        haven't interacted with you yet (Differs from department to department). BUT, if you have a
                        friend or a senior working under a professor then he/she can refer you for the position if any
                        available. Make sure you have the prior experience in that particular subjects.
                        Important point to note is to email the professors for TA/RA and to follow up for the same. Send
                        them request on the linkedIn too.
                        <br>
                        For the students who don't get a TA/RA position in the first semester can also work oncampus at
                        various location in the university campus. For this they can visit the location and ask the
                        manager if any positions are available. These include subway, wendy's etc. Also you can apply in
                        the hire-a-niner portal for any student union jobs which includes jobs like - technician, front
                        desk etc.
                        <br><br>
                        Important thing to note here is not to be taken by the flow of earning money since the end goal
                        of your degree is to get an internship and secure a full-time postion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Q - How to choose the subjects for each semester?
                        <br>
                        A - First, visit the degree requirement page for each departent. For example -
                        https://cci.uncc.edu/academics/computer-science/masters-program/ms-requirements
                        Then ask your seniors which subjects are hard/medium/easy. It differs from professor to
                        professor and their course structures. If you have a oncampus job then it becomes slighly
                        difficult to attend the 4 classes and at the same time complete the assignments and prepare for
                        your job interviews.
                    </p>
                    <p>
